# Stroke-prediction
Predicting if a patient will experience a stroke.

In the the repository you will find the python notebooks for different preprocessing of the dataset, the dataset used, and the report that was done for the purposes of the project. Translate was used for the pdf file, if anything does not make sense, its maybe because of the online translator.
